# R package development

Taking on package development inculcates in one best practices in programming: using a secluded development environment made possible by `{renv}` package
and Rstudio's project initialization functionality, documenting code, shared data and publishing user guides to get people started with the software. Package development workflow included
`{fussen}`, `{roxygen2}`, and `{devtools}`

The packaged is named [`pbwrangler`](https://bokola.github.io/pbwrangler/), it's goal to document functions used in reading, processing and writing field experimental data in potato breeding. 


# Shiny web app


`{shiny}` is undoubtedly a go to tool for building a web app that runs in production or just for presenting a proof of concept. I developed a [small app](https://bokola.shinyapps.io/shinyApp-data-quality/) as proof that I understand the underlying framework to be able to build an app that can be used in production.

# Reproducible anaytical pipelines in R

This was a 'do it yourself too' as I was reading an online version of [Rodrigues' reproducible piplines text](https://raps-with-r.dev/) . It reinforced my understanding of package development powered by `{fusen}`, reproducibility of package versions using `{renv}`, reproducible pipelines with `{targets}`, building and sharing docker containers in dockerhub and github, and continuous integration/development (CI/CD) using github actions. A branch with CI/CD running a docker container can be found [here](https://github.com/Bokola/Reproducible-analytical-pipelines-R/tree/rap-docker-ga).
